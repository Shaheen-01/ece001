<h1> Introduction to c++ </h1>
<p>C++ is a programming language of high
quality developed at Bell Labs by Bjarne Stroustrup.
C++ adds object oriented
functionality to its predecessor, C.
C++ is one of the most common programming languages for
graphical applications , for instance those running in Windows and Macintosh.C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming ( OOP ) language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. Originally, C++ was called "C with classes," as it had all the properties of the
C language with the addition of user-defined data types called "classes." Renamed C++ in 1983, C++ is considered an intermediate-level language, as it includes both high-level and low-level language features.

	<h3>Structure of a C++ Class

</h3>
	<p>
A class is user-defined datatype which has data members and member functions. In C++, classes are divided into the following three sections:<br>

1. Class Declaration Section<br>
2. Member Function Section<br>
3. Main Function Section<br>
</p>
<p>Using keyword class
to announce class

Inside the class you can
add member data and member functions.

Access to data members and member functions depends exclusively
on the access modifiers, i.e., public , private or protected. </p>
<p><b>A class always starts with { and ends with };</b></p>
<p>Member functions are methods
used to access class data.

Defining member roles can be
inside or outside the class.

This section contains description of the functions of
the member that are listed within the class. </p>
