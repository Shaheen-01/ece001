<body>
<p>Ruby is a scripting language built from the ground up for use in front end and back end web development and similar applications. It is a robust, dynamically typed, object-oriented language with syntax so easy to understand and high-level that it’s considered as close as you can get to coding in English.Released in the 1990s, Ruby is an open-sourced language created by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. He has stated that the language is designed to be both fun and productive. Ruby is scripted, meaning that it’s an interpreted language rather than a compiled one.  </p>

<p>Ruby is used most
to create web applications.
This is also a general-purpose language close to Python, and it
has many other uses such as data processing, prototyping, and design proofing. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most noticeable Ruby implementation
is Rails site, the Ruby-built development platform.
Homebrew is also written in Ruby, which is an
immensely common method for installing software packages on macOS.
This is the Metasploit protection program, which helps you to check
websites and applications for the ease with which they break into. </p>
<div>
	<p>Ruby has features that are similar to those of Smalltalk, Perl, and Python. Perl, Python, and Smalltalk are scripting languages. Smalltalk is a true object-oriented language. Ruby, like Smalltalk, is a perfect object-oriented language. Using Ruby syntax is much easier than using Smalltalk syntax.</p>
