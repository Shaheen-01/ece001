 <h1> What is meant by Programing language? </h1>
 <p>A programming language is a notation designed
to connect instructions to a computer or machine.
Programming languages are primarily used to monitor
a machine 's output, or to express algorithms.
There are actually thousands of
programming languages to be introduced.
Many languages must be specified in an imperative form
in the computer field, while other programming languages Using
declarative form.
The software can be divided into
two types such as syntax and semanthetic.
Some languages are defined by a standard
of SO such as the C language. </p>
<p>A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.

Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.</p>

  <div class="Types of programing language">
  <h2>Types of programing language</h2>
  <ol>
  <li> Procedural Programming Language</li>
  <p>The programming language of the procedures is used to
execute a series of statements that result in a test.
Usually, multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements are used in
this type of programming language which distinguishes them from functional programming languages.
Procedural language functions may control variables, other
than the value returns of the function.
Printing out
information for example. </p>
  <li> Functional Programming Language</li>
  <p>They are designed specifically to handle
applications for symbolic computation and list processing.
Functional programming is
based on maths.
Some of the common programming
functional languages include: Python, Erlang, Haskell. </p>
<li>Logic Programming Language</li>
<p>These kinds of languages allow programmers to make declarative statements and
then allow the machine to reason about the implications of those statements.
In a sense, this language does not tell the computer how to
do something, but rather how to use restrictions on what to do. To call these groups ” types  of language ” is really a bit confusing. It’s easy to program in an object-oriented style in C language. In truth, most of the languages include ideas and features from various domains, which only helps to increase the  usefulness of these types of languages. Nevertheless, most of the programming languages do not best in all styles of programming. </p>

<div>
	<p>There are two broad programming language classes,
those with formal programming and object-oriented ones.
In the first example, the language consists of a set of instructions and commands as well as a set of laws
for their application; in this example, the propositional logic plays a central role and all operations may be subjected to logical relations. Programming languages refer to various types of expressions and
logical rules of structuring that generate recurring and systematic tasks.
They are of great importance because they allow the generation
of various systems that serve tasks that satisfy users ' needs. Awareness of any programming language can be very
useful for improving problem-solving and task automation capabilities.
This sort of awareness combined with some simple notions of algorithms
will definitely open up a whole new panorama of job opportunities.</p>
