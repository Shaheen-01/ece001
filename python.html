<h1>intorduction to python</h1>
<p>Python is named after the comedy television show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. It is not named after the Python snake.Learning python is easy as this is a expressive and high level programming language, which means it is easy to understand the language and thus easy to learn.Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.</p>

	<h2>Python have many Features</h2>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Web Development – Python-based Application
System such as Django and Flask
They help you write server side code to help
you handle database, write backend logic, map urls etc. </li><br>
<li>Game development</li><br>
<li> You can develop desktop application in Python using library like TKinter or QT.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

<!--this will not appear -->
<div>Python is a programming
language of general purpose.
So you can use the programming language
to build desktop as well as web applications.
Python can also be used to
create complex scientific and numerical applications.
Python has features designed to
promote data processing and visualisation </div>
<p>You can take advantage of Python's data analysis features to build
custom Big Data solutions without putting extra time and effort into this.
At the same time, Python's data visualization libraries and APIs
allow you to more appealingly and effectively display and present data. </p>
<P>Python as an open source programming language helps
to greatly reduce the expense of software development.
Also several open source Python frameworks, libraries and development tools
can be used to reduce development time without increasing development cost. </P>
<p>You can also choose from a wide variety of open
source Python frameworks and programming tools according to your particular needs.
For example, using robust Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask,
Pyramid, Bottle and Cherrypy can simplify and speed up web application development. </p>
<p>Python is currently running
a great many operating systems.
Python interpreters can also be used to
run the code on different platforms and devices.
Python is also an
interpreted language for the programming.
It helps you to run the
same code without recompiling, on multiple platforms. </p>
